A modern single-page website for a personal portfolio. The site should have a sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling to sections: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. The Home section has a full-screen hero image with my name and a call-to-action button. The About Me section includes a photo and a short bio in a two-column layout. The Projects section displays six project cards in a responsive grid with hover effects. Each card should have an image, title, and short description. The Contact section has a simple contact form with fields for name, email, and message, and a submit button. Include a footer with social media icons linked to placeholders. Use clean typography, a modern color palette, and subtle animations when scrolling.
